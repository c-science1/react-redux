# Basic technical React / Redux test
## We have put together this very simple test. The fastest completion time is currently 12m 46s.

Please take a look at the below tasks:

- [ ] Load the notifications into the component - done
- [ ] Complete toggle notifications logic - done
- [ ] Add functionality to "Toggle show unacknowledged" - done
- [ ] Add functionality to "Acknowledge all" - done
- [ ] Add functionality to "Delete acknowledged" -done
- [ ] Colour the notifications date to #999 -done
- [ ] Colour a notificaitons title red if it is older than 10 days, and still unacknowledged - done
- [ ] Set opacity for any acknowledged notifications - done

Once complete, we would prefer it to be uploaded to github, etc and email us a link to the repo.
If this is not possible, please ZIP the src and email it back to us.
